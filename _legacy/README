This is a very outdated version of my personal saltstack setup. Some things
have been intentionally left out or broken because it is important to not
blindly copy/paste random blobs found on the internet.

There will be an update (or new repository) in the future to show a more
robust and dynamic version of this salt setup that includes DCIM/IPAM.
